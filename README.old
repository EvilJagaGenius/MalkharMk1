The Isle of Malkhar.  My next programming project, I might as well explain myself.

On the Isle of Malkhar, every person can use magic.  It's not some demonic sorcery, it's just a fact of life.  There are other peoples in Malkhar's universe, of course, but only those that have lived in Malkhar can use this power.  The land is split into provinces--Kentaria, Aquia, Izalgia, Isiandarth, Indivein, Dragonia, and the Moreland.  For each province, there is a certain elemental power: Air, Water, Ice, Lightning, Nature, Fire, and Earth.  Most of the time, wizards will stick to these elements and their variations.

However, there's one variation to this rule.  Necromancers are born with an innate control over Life and Death.  Because of this power constantly flowing through them, they age faster than ordinary humans - but can leech the life out of others to extend their lives indefinitely.  Necromancers typically go mad with this power, trying to take over the world - legend has it one such Necromancer led the Last Necromancer War, a savage fight that reduced the Moreland to nothing but a dead wasteland.  After the war, a law was passed, declaring that every Necromancer be hunted down and killed, whatever their age.

One Necromancer calling himself Mendumen is the first to survive this purge, and he's out for revenge for the hundreds of Necromancers slain.

In the palace of Malkhar, there are two gemstones that hold the root of all magic - the Crystals of Time and Space.  Two guardians are chosen to learn the powers of the gems and defend them with their lives.  Disregarding the odds, Mendumen stormed the castle - his goal to steal the gems and use their power to freeze Malkhar in space-time forever.  But before he could cast his own spell, the guardians cast their own counterspell, freezing themselves and the gems to keep them from Mendumen.  The power of the spell would last ten years - and the time is almost up.

But it's a little-known fact on Malkhar that right before the guardians froze themselves, there was a prophecy.  When hope was gone and all seemed lost, a savior would come to Malkhar: a stranger, with all the magical powers of a native.  That savior would defeat the evil and bring peace back to the world.  And little does Mendumen know that underneath Malkhar, there's a pool.  And in the pool is a portal to another world--our world, to Earth.

And whoever finds that pool and swims through to Malkhar will find that the fate of a world suddenly rests on their shoulders.  They will become the Savior of Malkhar.

And I think you know what role you're going to play in the game, don't you...?
